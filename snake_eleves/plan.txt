Divide the task into two parts that can be coded in parallel:
-   Server
-   Client

-> What must it do ?
    *   Run the gameloop and print it to the screen every round
    *   Receive and accept client requests for players to join
    *   Pipe its STDOUT to the clients'
    *   Include the client into the game
    *   While !game-over: For each client : //CAN WE LISTEN TO ALL CLIENTS AT THE SAME TIME ?
        - Listen to their inputgit checs (snake movements)
        - Modify the gameloop to take the inputs into acount

    *   Connect to the server via thread
    *   Receive the user's commands
